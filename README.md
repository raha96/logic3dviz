Sample codes for 3D logic diagram visualization

The result of a side project, trying to visualize larger logic diagrams which can't be represented with planar graphs. The project is still in its infancy, and the files are not meant to be used, but to be studied as simple examples written by a fellow newbie for other newbies :) Obj files are handcrafted, with help from the code in `cpptools` folder. The code is not meant to be used as a library, and only contains a few basic functions. The object files can be imported into many 3D editors. I use Blender. Based on data & info from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file and .obj output from blender.
